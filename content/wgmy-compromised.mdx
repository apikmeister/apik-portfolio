# Compromised

Given **evidence.zip** file with *Where aRe you?* hint.

Let's unzip it and see what we have.

It's looks like a lot of Windows folders and files with useless *.ini* and *.lnk* extensions. Let's try to find something interesting.

Looks like I found a flag.png file. Let's try to open it.

<Image
  alt={`flag`}
  src={`/images/2023-12-17/compromised/flag-png.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Hmm, it's seems like a corrupted file. Or... **maybe not?** Let's check it with terminal.

  height={400}

Ahaa, it's a **zip** file. Let's unzip it.

<Image
  alt={`flag`}
  src={`/images/2023-12-17/compromised/flag-unzip.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

It's a **flag.txt** file, But it's **password protected**.

Instead of brute force it, I decided to check all the folders to find more files.

<Image
  alt={`flag`}
  src={`/images/2023-12-17/compromised/interesting2.png`}

I found a files with *.rdp* extension. It's a Remote Desktop Connection file. That's mean It previously had a connection to another computer.

In Terminal Server Client folder I found a file with *.bin* extension and *.bmc* extension.
I tried to google about it and find and article to a Medium post about it.

[Medium Post](https://medium.com/@yashkumarnavadiya/htb-no-place-to-hide-easy-forensics-challenge-b025c864607a)

It says that .bin file is a memory dump file and .bmc is a memory map file.

I use terminal to check the .bin file.

It has the same header as the Medium post. That's **RDP8bmp** format. Let's try to convert it to a image.

I use the same tools as the Medium post.

It's hard to see, with a lot of scattered images. So I found another workaround to combine it all together.

<Image

<Image
  alt={`flag`}
  src={`/images/2023-12-17/compromised/collage.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}

It's looks like a screenshot of a Windows desktop. Let's try to find something interesting.

Ahaa, a zip password, let's try to unzip the flag.txt file and get the flag.
