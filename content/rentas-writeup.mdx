### 1. Simple Lazy (Web)

We are given a php website with a search form, and 3 links on the site.

  alt={`Simple Lazy Website`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/web/web-given.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

With further investigation, we found that the **Link 1** & **Link 2** give us some information about Linux, Ubuntu, Debian but **Link 3** showed a php error message.

<Image
  alt={`Simple Lazy Website`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/web/useful-web.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Based on the error, it seems that the website may be vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack.

Found a github repo that shows us how to [exploit Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-security-trivia/blob/master/Tricky-ways-to-exploit-PHP-Local-File-Inclusion.md). We can use the LFI with the php://filter to read the source code of **page3.php** in base64.

```
https://simplelazy.ctf.rawsec.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/page3
```

<Image
  alt={`Decoded Base64 of page3.php`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/web/decode-page3.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Decode page3.php base64 and follow to **esdasxasdcessxsadx.php**.

```
https://simplelazy.ctf.rawsec.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/esdasxasdcessxsadx
```

<Image
  alt={`Decoded Base64 of esdasxasdcessxsadx.php`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/web/decode-flag.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

The flag is there nice `RWSC{S1MPL3_4ND_L4ZY}`.

## 2. Hidden Discord (Misc)

For this challenge, we obtained an invite link to a discord server named Hidden Discord.

<Image
  alt={`Hidden Discord Server`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/misc/hidden-discord.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Goes straight to the discord server owner profile and check for any clue or flags!

<Image
  alt={`Hidden Discord Server Owner`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/misc/zoragon.png`}
  width={300}
  height={200}
/>

Looks like the owner have a role named **_hidden roles_**. Maybe there is flag in the roles description or something.

The topic of text channel **hints** also gave us a hint to look at the roles.

But I can't seem to find a way to look deeper into the roles and continue to look into another obvious section of the discord server.

<Image
  alt={`Hidden Discord Event`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/misc/event.png`}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

There's an event happening now on the server. By clicking on the event, we can see the event details with a **PART 3** for the flag that is **d3v3l0p3r\_**. We also have a clue to **Find the CATegory? üêà‚Äç‚¨õüêà**. Maybe we need to find a **cat** that knows how to use discord :3. I continue the adventure...

<Image
  alt={`Voice Channel Chat`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/misc/voice-channel-chat.png`}
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

By peeking into the voice channel chat, we got the **PART 1** of the flag which is **RWSC\{r34d\_**.

I happened to notice something is off with server **icon**. The server icon got an odd color on the white background. I used Discord Web and Inspect Element to try to download the server icon and check the image.

<Image
  alt={`Hidden Discord Server Icon`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/misc/server-icon.webp`}
  width={300}
  height={200}
/>

Looks like we found another part. I used the given icon link from discord to enlarge it using the size parameter.

```
https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/1202263455466541096/bfa6d5f2ed8067d3367791ed5b4d6941.webp?size=320
```

The **PART 5** of the flag is **r3f3r3nc3\}**.

```
RWSC{r34d_ - PART 1
- PART 2
d3v3l0p3r_ - PART 3
- PART 4
r3f3r3nc3} - PART 5
```

2 more parts to go. I continue to look for the **cat** in server members using the search and found the **cat**. The **cat** doesn't seem to be appeared in the member list. Maybe because he have the _*hidden roles*_.

Here I got stuck to find the last 2 parts of the flag but then I remembered there is a discord bot that can give information about the server details in deep. Maybe some API or something that can help me to find the last 2 parts of the flag.

Tried to read the discord api documentation and found a way to retrieve **server info** using api. So I started to CURL the server info.

```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads]
‚îî‚îÄ$ curl https://discord.com/api/v9/guilds/1202263455466541096 -H "Authorization: <REDACTED>"
```

and we got the response with the **PART 2** of the flag which is **d15c0rd\_**.

```json
...
    {
      "id": "1202265647393021994",
      "name": "PART 2:d15c0rd_",
      "description": null,
      "permissions": "0",
      "position": 2,
      "color": 0,
      "hoist": false,
      "managed": false,
      "mentionable": false,
      "icon": null,
      "unicode_emoji": null,
      "flags": 0
    },
...
```

~~btw I started to guess the flag here lmao.~~

Then I continue to play around with the discord api around the channel category and found a hit for our **PART 4** of the flag which is **API\_**.

```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads]
‚îî‚îÄ$ curl https://discord.com/api/v9/guilds/1202263455466541096/channels -H "Authorization: <REDACTED>"
```

```json
...
  {
    "id": "1202265477645082685",
    "type": 4,
    "flags": 0,
    "guild_id": "1202263455466541096",
    "name": "PART 4:API_",
    "parent_id": null,
    "position": 1,
    "permission_overwrites": [
      {
        "id": "1202263455466541096",
        "type": 0,
        "allow": "0",
        "deny": "410112263454033"
      }
    ]
  },
...
```

Combine it all together and we got the flag `RWSC{r34d_d15c0rd_d3v3l0p3r_API_r3f3r3nc3}`.

## 3. Resign Letter (Reverse Engineering)

We are given a zip file that contains a **.dotm** file. Searching through google that we know that the file is a Word 2007 template file.

But what we have to reverse on a Microsoft Word file?! I don't have any idea. So I binwalk the file to see a bunch of file inside it then extracted it all.

<Image
  alt={`Binwalk .dotm file`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/reverse/binwalk.png`}
  width={400}
  height={200}
/>

I lost and try to google for **Word Reverse Engineering** and found this useful blog post on [How to reverse engineer MSWord malware](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/how-to-reverse-engineer-msword-malware/). This is so helpful because the question said the **.dotm** file was detected as a virus.

Going through all the files, I found a the similar **vbaProject.bin** file in zip that we extracted.

I found a useful decompiler for the VBA bin file that is [pcode2code](https://github.com/Big5-sec/pcode2code) and decompile the **vbaProject.bin** file.

<Image
  alt={`Decompiled VBA Code`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/reverse/vba2code.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Welp, we found a link to an **.exe** file and proceed to download it.
Fool me, think it was now the time to do the "**_real Reverse Engineering_**" on the **.exe** file. I used **Ghidra** to decompile it and found nothing.

I was stuck and then i tried to just view the **.exe** **_strings_**.

<Image
  alt={`Strings of .exe file`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/reverse/password.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Here I found the command to add user with the password in base64 as the flag... It was this easy after all T_T.

Decode the password and we got the flag `RWSC{p@ss123}`.

## 4. Medell√≠n Cartel (OSINT)

For this OSINT challenge, we are given a tree information about the Medell√≠n Cartel. I am stuck**_(skill issue)_**. And maybe I am not a good detective T_T.

Not until the hint released!!

```
Hint 3#

Okay here's the clue.. After all day, u guys deserve this.

Medellin Cartel:
You might think the given picture, is useless. Guessy. But its not. If u are about to investigate a crime group. You have to criminal-profile every single member of the group. E.g what they do, eat, visit, etc. If u recon, Blacky AKA Nelson Hernandez is the only sicarios that has went to uniten IG. U should focus on that acc only. For real - If u went to other sicarios, u will get lost. Next step? Technical stuff. Dig the flag inside the IG, metadata is there. That is how u profile someone, dig deeper as u could on that acc.
```

My teammate found the [**blacky**](https://www.instagram.com/nelsonhernandez144/) account on Instagram. I used the **exiftool** to extract the metadata of the image but no luck. Tried a lot of metadata but still no luck.

Until I wanted to tried to inspect the instagram page and search for the flag format **RWSC** and bingo!!

<Image
  alt={`Instagram Flag on alt text`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/osint/inspect.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

We found the flag on the alt text of the instagram post profile feed image. `RWSC{Bl4cky_S1c4r1o}`

## 5. Last Hope (Network)

For this challenge, we are given a cap file. As I opened the cap file using **Wireshark**, I already saw the SSID for the network.

<Image
  alt={`Wireshark SSID`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/network/cap-file.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

I go straight to **Wireless > WLAN Traffic** as we know that we are dealing with a WiFi Connection.

<Image
  alt={`Wireshark WLAN Traffic`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/network/wlan-mac.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Now as we got the address for the Connection, I tried to filter the traffic using the **MAC Address** to find a wethere there is complete **EAPOL** 4 of 4 handshake.

<Image
  alt={`Wireshark EAPOL 4 of 4`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/network/complete-handshake.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

As we got the complete handshake, I tried to use **aircrack-ng** to crack the password using **wifite.txt** wordlist instead of **rockyou.txt**.

```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads]
‚îî‚îÄ$ aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/wifite.txt -b 7e:7f:a3:4c:5c:1a RAWSECWIFI-01.cap
```

<Image
  alt={`Aircrack-ng Password`}
  src={`/images/2024-03-06/rentas-ctf/network/cracked-pass.png`}
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

and we got the flag as `RWSC{anonymous}`.
